## Umbrella sampling analysis

Run the jupyter notebook Umbrella-sampling_WHAM.ipynb on AWSEM trajectories that have biasing factors within a range. ex. The biasing factor can be the global Q of the simulated protein.

The notebook outputs a few useful figures as well as pmf data. Two example pmf data are provided as pmf_139-147.txt and pmf_4BEX_assembly.txt.

If concatenating the results of trajectories is needed, use combine.ipynb to concatenate trajectories and plot energy profiles.
