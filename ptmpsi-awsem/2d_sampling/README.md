## 2d-sampling analysis

The pmf_139-147_concatenated is an example pmf datafile that can be generated by the codes in module 'umbrella sampling'. It is used in 2d-sampling as base data.

Run pmf_projection_concatenated_EP-Rg.ipynb to plot the 2d-sampling profile for E-potential and radius of gyration of a group of biased simulated trajectories. 

Run pmf_projection_concatenated_Qglobal-Rg.ipynb to plot the 2d-sampling profile for Q-global and radius of gyration of a group of biased simulated trajectories. 

If there are more types of data, e.g. Q-interface, the code can be modified to plot the cooresponding 2d-sampling profiles.
