# Analyzing AWSEM simulated trajectories

Codes for analyzing MD trajectories simulated by coarse-grained force field: AWSEM.

You can find the AWSEM package used in this project in /awsemmd-master/

and AWSEM related information at https://awsem-md.org/

This repository is composed of several analyzing modules as subdirectories containing related jupyter notebooks and Python codes, each subdirectory has its own readme file describing the use of scripts. The Python version for running these codes was 3.8.

The required Python packages to run the codes can be found in /required_packages/, but you can also create an environment in conda and use pip or conda to install them to the environment.
